#### intro :24
Hi. My name is Andrew Durham. I am a psychologist from the US. I have discovered a way for the psyche can heal itself of illness and trauma. Tonight, I will talk about _Darkroom Retreating and the Recovery of the Lost Self_.

First I will tell you the most basic things about darkroom retreating. Then I will talk about its main effect as I have experienced it over the past eight years: recovery of lost parts of myself. 

#### what is it? :11
A darkroom retreat consists of _resting_ in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food.

#### why do it? :16
for relief from overstimulation and distress
to rest from exhaustion
to heal from psychic illness and the psychic trauma that causes them

#### where does it come from? 1:36
Darkroom retreating has been used in secret for thousands of years by virtually all spiritual traditions, East and West, civilized and indigenous, from Taoism and Christianity to Navajo and Kogi Indians. They all consider it a high and difficult practice for becoming established in a true way of being.

I first heard about it in 2004 from my former spiritual teacher, a Hindu, because it is used in Ayurveda, India's healing tradition. Then I met an old hippy, Finn Po, who actually had a simple darkroom and who convinced me to try it in 2006. In two and a half days, I caught up on all the sleep I ever lost, feeling awake for the first time in decades. I was impressed.

Over the next two years, I learned to put darkroom retreating in a context of healing rather than spirituality. I integrated it with Natural Hygiene, a 180 year-old philosophy of health that could be described as applied physiology. It's motto is, "Health through healthful living". Basically, it greatly respects the self-preserving power of the organism, providing it only with normal conditions of life, like warmth, air, food, rest, exercise, etc. 

For the past five years, I have been retreating and supporting retreats for others, writing and speaking about it, and designing and building darkrooms. I have retreated 17 times for 2-6 days. It remains the most impressive, interesting, and fruitful thing I have come across in 26 years of searching and testing. 

#### how does it work? :58
The defining characteristic of organisms is self-preservation. This includes self-generation, self-maintenance, and self-healing. Healing includes repair, elimination, and re-energization. These processes occur at every scale, from cells to organs to systems to the organism as a whole. Everything they do is aimed at health. For organisms in nature, to be is to be healthy.

We started out healthy, and at least at our cores, it is how we remain. The processes of health are at work this moment in each one of us, doing their absolute best with what we are able to provide them. Innocence is from the Latin, _innocere_: not do wrong to. At our cores, every one of us remains innocent. Even the extremely lost souls running civilization's institutions.

From birth, even conception, we sustain major psychic trauma due to civilization's routine brutality.
However, the psyche is an organic system, therefore it is self-healing.
The primary requirement of healing is rest. We gain the extra vital energy necessary for healing, and we hold still so it can proceed.

##### 1:03
Unbelievably deep psychic rest occurs in total, extended darkness.
    - The circadian system, which controls our daily biological rhythms, responds to darkness by causing the entire organism to rest and sleep. The darker it is and the longer darkness lasts, the more intense this resting response is.
    - Sensation requires psychic processing, sight more than all the other senses combined. In darkness, we rest from this activity and conserve significant vital energy.
    - Due to its abstract nature, sight feeds the mind. In darkness, the mind's constant scheming for survival becomes slower, more difficult, and less interesting.
    - In a retreat, all the conditions of deep rest are provided: safety, solitude, warmth, fresh air, and natural food. :22
    
#### how do you do it? :40
- Make a darkroom out of your bedroom. I describe its design and construction technique in detail in my book. If you want help, I am available.
- Retreat when your place will be empty. Purchase food, turn off phones, and tell friends you are unavailable.
- Adopt the Hygienic attitude about healing. The unconscious, autonomic self will do most of the work. Give it center stage, supporting it with the few simple conditions it requires.

These are the basics of darkroom retreating. 

#### what happens? 2:44

:52
In the course of a retreat, I rarely know what is happening. I only know that something is happening. I can feel a deep rumbling in my being. Or boredom. Or perfect silence. Or I am crawling in my skin. Or free-associating like crazy. 

Likewise, I do not even know what it is about. Actually, I am glad to be left out of it. What do I care? It's none of my business.

But I always know the result. In some way, I come back to myself. I come to my senses. I feel more in my body. More whole, present, relaxed, energized, excited, even happy.

:32
Sometimes, I have cathartic insights. A process of the autonomic self involves some belief or habit that needs to change. So it informs me by showing me and letting me feel why. This naturally motivates me to immediately switch to a new track. The autonomic self also has repaired the parts of myself that would make this switch. The switch requires learning, feeling, and doing.

For example,
 - grown-up, 1-2 sentences
 - book, 1-2 sentences
 - sexual self, remainder

Maslow hierarchy of needs
five levels
1 food water air warmth sex
2 security
3 love & intimaciy

These last things are necessary, but they can wait. Regular frequent sex is critical to physical and psychical health. Are you living in a state of deprivation as a result of being in a state of shame, denial, trauma? Darkness is a way you can recover the part of yourself that would reverse this to confidence, directness, and joy.

I would like to thank the sexual radicals of our times---lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transexuals, and black and latino musicians for making sex part of public conversation---for helping the extremely repressed among us acknowledge that we have cocks and pussies, and we like doing stuff with them, alone and together.

1:20
We are right to think that something is wrong, that we must do something about it. We are wrong to think the conscious self is the part that must do it. The unconscious autonomic self is omniscient, omnipotent, and infallible: all-knowing, all-powerful, and incapable of making mistakes. It is 99% of ourselves. It is working right now, keeping our blood and breath flowing, our eyes blinking, our metabolism, posture, and a trillion other processes going. When the conscious self aligns with the unconscious self instead of denying its existence and stealing its work, miracles of self-recovery occur.

Some people call the unconscious self God. I am not the first to see, as I did in darkness, that God is merely an external projection of the lost part of the self. I already knew the deep self is good. But when I came to Sweden and saw how the word for good is spelled---g-o-d---that was it for me: logical proof of what Jesus said: "The Kingdom of God is within you".

In our incorruptible self-preserving essence lies our hope
