I have more feedback about this.

But the gmail share thing...  I guess I should have tested everything first. But my feedback is,  now I wish I had emailed my contact list myself. Then they would have received the letter, the very first thing I would want them to read about this.

The gmail share function (besides being clear about exactly what it is doing) should include the video and description, and have a photo I supply, not the one mentioning collecting money. It amounts to asking for the order before you make the sale.
